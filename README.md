# libft

Libft is the first project you will do as you enter a 42 school. In this project you are required to write your own library containing several fundamental functions.
These functions will help you greatly in future projects. Thus, a strong foundation is what you would want, going forward.

Moulinette traces show very little tests performed upon these tests. Therefore, you should see Moulinette from this point onward, is the industry standard.
Your fellow hivers will constantly pushing your quality of codes much higher, and it's a great practice.

My libft is validated with 101/100 points (1 extra bonus function)
